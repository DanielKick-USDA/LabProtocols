## Recap:

This supplementary presentation from this week can be found [here](./240805_Meeting5.pptx).

-   Logistics
    -   We're running a new [scheduling poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?25825400-b3JmD) for the fall since we have members whose schedule may change with the new semester.
    -   Because of this, our next meeting will be on the 20th and the one after that will be TBD.
-   MLP in PyTorch
    -   We discussed some of the logistics around building models in PyTorch including
    -   Dataloaders
    -   Moving tensors to the GPU
    -   [nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html) classes

## Preparation for Next Session

The content for the next two sessions will dovetail:

We're going to look at transformers next so

-   For next session:

    -   Watch Grant Sanderson's [Attention in transformers](https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?si=ZegmRC8nDrLPWNlr) (26m)

    -   Begin [Let's build GPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) (1h56)

    -   We're planning to review [Santurkar, et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11604) ("How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization?") for the folks that couldn't be at Meeting 4. If you haven't read it give it a read!

    -   Decide if you're game to present a project or paper "show and tell" and what project you're planning or working on that you.

-   For the session after that:

    -   Finish [Let's build GPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) (1h56)

Cheers,

Daniel
