## Introduction 


Hello Everyone!

I think everyone who will fill out the survey has and it looks like
Tuesdays from 11-12 fits the most people’s schedules. Our first meeting
will be Tuesday May 7th at 11-12am.

I’ve included information on preparing for the first session below and
please let me know if you have any questions.

Best, Daniel

Logistics: I have reserved room 219a in Curtis Hall for those attending
in person and there will be a videochat link in the invitation for those
attending virtually. I’m looking into recording the meetings and making
them internally available for anyone who can’t make it, but I can’t
guarantee I’ll have this sorted.

Preparing for our first meeting: Before we meet I would like everyone to
write down your answers to the following questions.

1.  Are you interested in the low-level details of deep learning or
    mostly high-level application?
2.  Where do you see yourself using deep learning? In the lab or for
    personal use?
3.  After learning these topics what goals will you be better situated
    to achieve?

Closer to the date of I will send out some instructions on the software
we’ll be using. Please follow these setup instructions.

Our first meeting will be composed of three parts. First, I’ll give a
brief introduction. Next, we’ll talk about everyone’s answers to the
questions above. The goal of this is to help people with similar uses in
mind and interests find each other – so over time we can grow from a
learning group to a community of practice. Finally, we’ll talk about
software and setup to fix any issues for the next meeting.

Future meetings: Beyond this first meeting we’ll have some lecture and
exercises that we’ll complete in between sessions. In the sessions we’ll
talk though the exercises and what people found challenging or
interesting.

The material will initially focus on building networks from the ground
up so when we start using research grade libraries how they work isn’t a
black box. After a few sessions we’ll take stock and adjust course as
needed.

## Setup Instructions

Hello Everyone,

Here are the setup instructions. It should take only a few minutes to
get set up, but please go ahead and do this before our kickoff meeting
next week. That way we can address any issues that arise.

To start out with we’ll use python through jupyter notebooks. If you’ve
worked in the R ecosystem, these are similar to Rmarkdown or quarto
documents that let you mix notes and equations in with your code. There
are two options you can use. The easiest is to use “Google Collab” which
will take care of the setup for you. The hardware your notebook will not
be especially powerful but that is perfectly fine for starting out.

Option 1: • Create a google account if you don’t have one. • Keep this
url handy for next week https://colab.research.google.com/ Option 2: •
Install Anaconda https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/ or
miniconda https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html • Using
either the graphical interface or the command line
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#
create an environment and ensure that at least Jupiter is installed
https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter

Assuming you opt for option 2 with the graphical user interface, select
environments

Next select create

Select python and choose a name for your environment. (Don’t worry about
the version of python just now, we’ll change it when or if it becomes an
issue)

Now we need to install jupyter notebook. By default anaconda displays
the installed packages so we’ll need to switch to all or uninstalled
before searching for it. Find it, check the box and press apply below.

You may see a pop up requesting that you install notebook’s
dependencies.

After the installation if finished now you can right click on the play
symbol and launch a jupyter notebook.

This should automatically launch in your default browser.
