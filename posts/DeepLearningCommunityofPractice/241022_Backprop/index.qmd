## For Next Week:
-   Next week will be a "catch-up" session since the backpropagation material is critical for understanding how networks are optimized and takes a fair bit of time to work through. 
-   Time permitting we *may* introduce the bigram model or dig deeper into dataloaders depending on the length of the discussion next week. 


## Materials

-   Here is the notebook I wrote during our meeting today [(Demo Notebook)](./InClassExample.ipynb.tar.gz) showing how how gradients are tracked in PyTorch and how to create a small multilayer perceptron (MLP).
