## For Next Meeting

-   We're starting off from zero and implementing the core engine that powers deep learning: back propagation.

-   Please watch *at least* the first 1h22m of Andrej Karpathy's lecture [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) and try to follow along in your Jupyter Notebook.

-   Please note what you find confusing -- someone else probably finds it confusing too!

-   Reminder: For this you'll need to install `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `graphviz`, and `pytorch`.

    -   If you're using `conda` you may need to install `graphviz` using `pip`. You can do this *from your notebook* by typing the command `!pip install graphviz`. The leading `!` will cause this to be treated as a shell command rather than a python command.

    -   `numpy` [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy) [pip](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

    -   `matplotlib` [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib) [pip](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

    -   `graphviz` [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/graphviz) [pip](https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/)

    -   `pytorch` [Install Instructions](https://pytorch.org/)

## Materials

-   Here is a tiny neural network in Excel ( [File](./0502_nn_demo.xlsx)). Download it and try changing the weights and biases of the layers! In practice we'll change all the weights and biases at once, but this is nice for building intuition.

-   Here are the [Meeting Slides](./0507_KickOffMeeting.pptx).
