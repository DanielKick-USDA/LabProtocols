## Recap of Today's Meeting

-   Questions to Ponder:

    -   How do you envision yourself using python and deep learing?

        -   In the lab?

        -   For personal use?

        -   Both?

    -   What *application* excites you most?

        -   *How small* could you make this project?

        -   *When* could you work on this?

    -   *What goals* will you be better prepared to achieve by learning these topics?

-   Before introducing deep learning we'll ensure a basic comfort with python.

    -   To do this we'll start at a high level (data visualization) then introduce low level concepts.

The presentation slides can be found [here](./KickOff.pptx).

## Materials

Today's slides use data from Allison Horst's [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) data package (see also [Gorman KB, Williams TD, Fraser WR (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081) ).

The files for today are provided zipped together [here](penguin_plotly_worksheet.tar).

When unzipped you should have

-   A dataset (penguins.csv)
-   A worksheet (penguin_plotly_worksheet.ipynb)
-   A set of solutions (penguin_plotly.ipynb)

If you can't open the zipped files, download these files, changing the extension of the worksheet and solutions from `.txt` to `.ipynb`.

-   [penguins.csv](./penguins.csv)
-   [penguin_plotly_worksheet.txt](./penguin_plotly_worksheet.txt)
-   [penguin_plotly.txt](./penguin_plotly.txt)

## For Next Meeting

If you have not completed the visualization exercises, do. To solidify your understanding, use data you have from a project and plot it with python!

While not required, it's recommended that you have a learning partner. Talk with folks in your lab or email someone in a different lab if you want someone to learn with!
