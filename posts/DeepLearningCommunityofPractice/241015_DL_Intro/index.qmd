## For Next Meeting

-   We're starting off from zero and implementing the core engine that powers deep learning: back propagation.

-   For our next meeting on the 22nd we have an open discussion of backpropagation scheduled. The core video for this session is this one [Backpropagation 2h25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) in which youâ€™ll build a computational graph and see how values flow forward through this graph to calculate a prediction and backward to calculate gradients. I recommend at minimum watching the video and ideally implementing the code in it as well. 

-   Note that the in the video description there are links to the notebooks that Andrej Karpathy builds during the video. I find this especially helpful for identifying errors in my code.

-   Please note what you find confusing -- someone else probably finds it confusing too!

## Materials

-   Here is a tiny neural network in Excel ( [File](./0502_nn_demo.xlsx)). Download it and try changing the weights and biases of the layers! In practice we'll change all the weights and biases at once, but this is nice for building intuition.

-   Here are the [Meeting Slides](./241001_Python_Fundamentals.pptx).
