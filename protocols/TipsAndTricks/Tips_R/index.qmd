R allows for comments to exist _in tables_. If there's a `#` in the table you're reading (e.g. as a part of a column name like `chromosome#`) then it can cause an unequal number of values between rows (everything on that line following it is ignored). The solution is to specify the comment character explicitly to be used (it can be '' to have no comment characters). Here's an example:

```
echo "a, b, c#, d" > test_table.txt
> Rscript -e "read.table('test_table.txt')"
#   V1 V2 V3
# 1 a, b,  c
> Rscript -e "read.table('test_table.txt', comment.char = '')" # with no comment character, all entries will be read
#   V1 V2  V3 V4
# 1 a, b, c#,  d
```
