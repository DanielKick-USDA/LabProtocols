We are (re)iterating on the material we discussed over the summer so if this is the first time you're joining us don't worry about reading back through the older posts. If someone has directed you to this page and you'd like to be added to the mailing list, please get in touch with us.\n\n## What to Expect\n\nWe'll be using python to go work from derivatives to generatively pretrained transformer models. Along the way we'll talk about...\n\n-   What deep learning models do\n\n-   How deep learning models are trained\n\n-   Architectural decisions to improve performance\n\n-   Tools used for model development and refinement\n\nAlong the way we'll also talk a fair bit about python, the logistical challenges that surround model training, and some of the ways models can learn the wrong things.\n\nWe're interested in building understanding and intuition so as to avoid cases where you only *think* your model is working well. We're going to encourage twin prescriptions of skepticism and caution in working with models. Instead of \"move fast and break things\" think \"move *slow* and *build* things\".\n\n## What We Expect\n\nWe recommend viewing this group not as a class but a convening of autodidactic learners. Initially we'll have a presentations coving foundational topics which will give way to open discussions. Having a list of thoughts and questions will be valuable to make the most of these sessions.\n\nSince it's *really* hard to train models on paper, we expect folks to be writing (and debugging) code. We recommend budgeting time for the videos *and* writing exploratory code on your own. It can be useful to write the code featured in the videos in parallel with them, which may substantially increase the amount of time the materi\n\nal requires (and one's comfort and fluency with these topics). Futher, applying or extending what you have seen to small data sets is a great way to solidify understanding.\n\nFinally, we recommend identifying at least one peer that you can partner with. Explaining a new concept is a great way to solidify your understanding and having someone you can ask for a fresh perspective from is hugely useful. Although we're interested in technical knowledge, we also want to increase connections between labs and the folks in them.\n\nIn summary:\n\n-   Keep an eye on the upcoming materials\n\n-   Write code, make mistakes, debug code\n\n-   Make friends, ask for help, and teach others\n\n## What We Have Planned\n\nBelow is our \"working draft\" for the fall. Based on feedback from the summer session we're beginning with python so doesn't add friction when we use it to build models. We may also make a few additions to these topics (such as working with images, sequences, or modeling distrbutions) or add presentations on folks planned or ongoing projects to talk about how these model go from the classroom to the lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Month | Day|Before                                                                                             |Session                                 |After                                                                                                                                                                      |Deep.Dive                      |\n|:-----|---:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|\n|Sept. |  17|                                                                                                   |                                        |                                                                                                                                                                           |                               |\n|Sept. |  24|Pre-Meeting Setup                                                                                  |Python: Application                     |                                                                                                                                                                           |                               |\n|Oct.  |   1|                                                                                                   |Python: Fundamentals                    |                                                                                                                                                                           |                               |\n|Oct.  |   8|                                                                                                   |Python: Classes, Deep Learning Overview |[To Deliver You From the Preliminary Terrors](https://calculusmadeeasy.org/1.html), [The Intuitive Notion of the Chain Rule](https://webspace.ship.edu/msrenault/geogebracalculus/derivative_intuitive_chain_rule.html), [What is a Neural Network?

For help installing Anaconda, see this [link](/posts/DeepLearningCommunityofPractice/240501_PreMeeting/).\n\nAlthough not strictly necessary I also recommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Microsoft's [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) plugin. The former provides a nice editor for notebooks and the latter a way to collaboratively edit a code (think \"google docs for code\" or Teletype).\n",
